					<h4>Introduction to TSCH</h4>
					<p>
						Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) is a MAC protocol that uses time synchronization to schedule
						communication in
						time-slots. It is based on the IEEE 802.15.4e standard.
					</p>
					<p>
						TSCH is a deterministic protocol that provides high reliability and low power consumption.
						However, its performance largely depends on the TSCH schedule.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>TSCH schedule</h4>
					<p>
						TSCH schedule is a set of time-slots that are assigned to each node in the network. Each
						time-slot is assigned to a specific channel and a specific node.
					</p>
					<p>
						TSCH schedule is defined by the following parameters:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment list-space">Slotframe size (\(|C|\))</li>
						<li class="fragment list-space">Number of time-slots</li>
						<li class="fragment list-space">Number of channels</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>TSCH schedule example</h4>

				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Orchestra TSCH scheduler</h4>
					<p>
						Orchestra is an autonomous TSCH scheduler. It
						runs without any central scheduling entity nor negotiation. The key idea
						is to provision a set of slots for different traffic planes, and to
						define the slots in such a way that they can be automatically
						installed/removed as the RPL topology evolves.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Orchestra</b> mainly <b>uses three</b> slotframes in its default configuration:
						<em>time source</em>, <em>unicast</em>, and <em>default</em>.
						The time source is used to sync the node with its parent. The default slotframe is used for any
						other traffic than time source and unicast messages.

					<h3>Introduction to Reinforcement Learning</h3>
					<p>
						Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning technique that enables an agent to learn
						through trial and error by interacting with its environment.
					</p>
					<p>
						RL is composed of the following elements:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment list-space">Agent</li>
						<li class="fragment list-space">Environment</li>
						<li class="fragment list-space">State</li>
						<li class="fragment list-space">Action</li>
						<li class="fragment list-space">Reward</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Agent</h3>
					<p>
						An agent is an entity that interacts with the environment. It is responsible for taking
						actions and learning from the environment.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Environment</h3>
					<p>
						An environment is the world in which the agent interacts. It is responsible for providing
						feedback to the agent.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>State</h4>
					<p>
						A state is a representation of the environment at a given time. It is used by the agent to
						make decisions.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Action</h4>
					<p>
						An action is a decision made by the agent. It is used to change the state of the environment.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Reward</h4>
					<p>
						A reward is a feedback from the environment to the agent. It is used to evaluate the agent's
						actions.

					<h4>TSCH slotframe design</h4>
					<p>
						We have defined <b>four different slotframes</b> to enable SDN concepts in the sensor network:
						time
						source, control plane, data plane, and default.
						The time source and default slotframes performs same tasks as Orchestra, whereas the control
						plane
						slotframe is used for all control traffic; TSCH schedules and routes configuration.
						Additionally, the data plane slotframe is used for data packets.

					<h4>ELISE Reinforcement learning module</h4>
					<p>Recall aims of the RL module:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="list-space">To develop a reinforcement learning (RL) solution that leverage the
							framework to dynamically adapt the network reliability, power efficiency, and delay of the
							WSN giving a set of user requirements</li>
						<li class="list-space">To design a reward model based on a multi-objective function that enables
							the selection of the optimal slotframe size given a set of user requirements</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>RL module diagram</h4>
					<img src="images/elise-rl-module.png" alt="rl101" style="max-width: 50%">
					<p>ELISE follows the typical three-tier principles
						for SDWSNs, where the control plane layer collects
						data, orchestrates resources, performs intelligent calculations,
						and deploys new network configurations into sensor nodes.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>State space</h4>
					<p>
						The state space (\(\mathcal{S}\)) is the set of all possible states that the agent can observe.
						It is defined by
						the following parameters:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="list-space">user requirements weights (\(\alpha\), \(\beta\), \(\gamma\)) which are
							user-defined coefficients for power consumption,
							delay, and reliability, respectively.
						</li>
						<li class="list-space">power (p), delay (d) and packet delivery ratio (r).</li>
						<li class="list-space" style="color:blue">last active timeoffset in the schedule (\(\lambda\))
						</li>
						<li class="list-space" style="color:blue">the current slotframe size (\(|C|\))</li>
					</ul>
					\(\mathcal{S} \triangleq \{(\alpha_1, \beta_1,\gamma_1,p_1,d_1,r_1,\lambda_1, |C|_1),...,\\
					(\alpha_{i}, \beta_{i},\gamma_{i},p_i,d_i,r_i,\lambda_{i},|C|_{i})\}\)
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Action space</h4>
					<p>
						The action space (\(\mathcal{A}\)) is the set of all possible actions that the agent can take.
						We have defined three possible actions:
					</p>
					<!-- <p> -->
					\(\mathcal{A}= \begin{cases}\Uparrow |C|,\\
					\Downarrow |C|,\\
					|C|\end{cases}\)
					<!-- </p> -->
					<!-- <ul>
						<li class="list-space">increase the slotframe size</li>
						<li class="list-space">decrease the slotframe size</li>
						<li class="list-space">keep the current slotframe size</li>
					</ul> -->
					<p>
						The upcoming slotframe size is then calculated as follows.
					</p>
					<p class="list-space">
						\( |C|^{DP} \triangleq \{a:gcd(a,|C|^{EB},|C|^{CP},|C|^{DF})=1\}\)
					</p>
					<p>
						Where gcd represents the greatest common divisor, and
						\(|C|^{EB}\),\(|C|^{CP}\), and \(|C|^{DF}\) are the slotframe sizes of the
						EB, control, and default traffic planes.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Immediate Reward function</h4>
					<p>
						The reward function (\(\mathcal{R}\)) is a function that maps the state-action pair to a real
						number. It is used to evaluate the agent's actions.
					</p>
					<p>
						We have defined the reward function as follows.
					</p>
					<p>
						\(\mathcal{R}(s,a)=\begin{cases} -\mathcal{G}_{max}, \qquad
						if~|C|^{DP}\geq\mu~or~|C|^{DP}\leq\lambda
						\\
						\Upsilon-\Omega, \qquad\qquad if~\lambda<|C|^{DP}<\mu \end{cases}\) </p>
							<p>
								Where \(\mathcal{G}_{max} \)is the maximum penalty for taking an invalid slotframe size.
								\(\mu\) is the maximum slotframe size.
								$\Upsilon$ is a constant that makes sure the immediate reward stays always positive.
								$\Omega$ is the multi-objective cost function.
							</p>
							<!-- \(\mathcal{R} \triangleq \alpha \times p + \beta \times d + \gamma \times r\) -->
							<!-- <p>
								Where \(\alpha\), \(\beta\), and \(\gamma\) are the user requirements weights for power
								consumption, delay, and reliability, respectively.
							</p> -->
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Multi-objective cost function</h4>
					<p>
						We have defined the multi-objective cost function as follows.
					</p>
					<p>
						\(\Omega = \alpha \cdot \widetilde{p} + \beta \cdot \widetilde{d} + \gamma \cdot
						(1-\widetilde{r})\) subject to \(\alpha + \beta
						+
						\gamma = 1\) and
						\(\\0\le \alpha,\beta,\delta \le 1\)
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>
						Terminating conditions
					</h4>
					<p>
						These conditions state when a episode should end. We have defined three terminal conditions.
					</p>
					<ul class="medium-text">
						<li>
							<b>Maximum number of iterations:</b> episodes end when the maximum number of actions taken
							has
							been reached.
							The maximum number of iterations has to be greater than the iterations needed to reach the
							optimal state.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Minimum slotframe size:</b> episodes terminate early if the chosen slotframe size is
							below
							the minimum slotframe size of the TSCH schedule.
							This is a penalty for taking an action that misconfigures the network.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Maximum slotframe size:</b> episodes terminate early if the chosen slotframe size exceeds
							the
							maximum sloftframe size of the TSCH schedule.
							This is a penalty for taking an action with a large slotframe size that leads to a worse
							accumulative rewards, therefore minimizing the learning time of the DQN.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

						We defined the network power consumption (\(\overline{P_N}\)) as the average power consumption

						This is first calculated at each \(n\) \(\epsilon\) \(N\). The energy consumption \(E\) of

					<equation>
						\(E_n=V\sum_{k\in F}ts_k*i_k\)

					<h4>Average power consumption</h4>

					<p>
						<b>Note:</b> From the RL point of view, this approach mathematically does not forget previous

						In a TSCH network, a data packet delay of sensor \(n\) can be calculated as follows.

						SDWSN approximation model

					<p>
						<b>Why?</b> This is necessary because the training of the model requires to run multiple
						episodes.
						The number of episodes to learn to solve this particular problem is in the order of 100
						thousand.
					</p>
					<p>
						The main bottle neck when deploying the entire system (controller + network simulator) is the
						processing speed of Cooja. To complete one episode of 50 iterations requires approximately 10
						mins.
						Therefore, this is not a suitable approach to train the model.
					</p>
					<p>
						In contrast, if the TSCH network can be mathematically modeled in function of the slotframe
						size, the processing speed per episode can be significantly reduced.
						In fact, the model is able to solve the problem, while maximizing the accumulative reward in 20
						mins (300k episodes).
					</p>
					<p>
						This approximation model is also useful for hyperparameters tuning using Optuna, which takes
						around 10 hours.

						The SDWSN approximation model
					</h4>
					<p>
						The main objective of the SDWSN approximation model is to estimate the values of the overall
						network power consumption (\(\widetilde{P_N}\)), delay (\(\widetilde{D_N}\)), and reliability
						(\(\widetilde{R_N}\)) when changing the slotframe size.
						Therefore, allowing to easily calculate the immediate reward of an action taken.
					</p>
					<p>
						The values of \(\widetilde{P_N}\), \(\widetilde{D_N}\), and \(\widetilde{R_N}\) are estimated
						using the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator (\(E=\sum_{j=0}^{k}|p(x_j)-y_i|^2\)).

						We have selected 10 sensor nodes of the grenoble site of the FIT IoT-LAB. The location of the
						sensor nodes is shown below.
					</p>
					<p>
						The obtain the values of \(\widetilde{P_N}\), \(\widetilde{D_N}\), and \(\widetilde{R_N}\) in
						function of the slotframe size, we program a simple task in the SDWSN controller.
						The controller, via the NC module, sends NC-TSCH packets with different slotframe sizes.
					</p>
					<p> At each timestep, the controller selects a slotframe size \(s\in S\). Where \(S\) is the set of
						slotframe size numbers that are mutually prime to other slotframes. It repeats this process
						multiple times.
					</p>

						We then plot the values for \(\widetilde{P_N}\),
						\(\widetilde{D_N}\), and \(\widetilde{R_N}\) using the 95% confidence interval. We then find the
						vector coefficients \(v\) that minimizes the squared error in the degree order of three, three,
