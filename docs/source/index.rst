Welcome to ELISE's documentation!
=================================

ELISE is a framework built upon multidisciplinary research efforts of Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), and Machine Learning (ML). The aim of ELISE is to provide a holistic architecture to support run-time network reconfigurations and deployment of  ML algorithms in WSNs. \
We currently support reinforcement learning to adapt the slotframe size of the TSCH protocol give a set of user requirements. A detail description of the project can be found in the paper.

A overview of the framework is shown below:

|sdwsn_architecture|

The ELISE project comprises two main components or repositories: data plane , control plane.

* Data plane: devices that reside on this plane runs on an embedded operating systems. Among the embedded operating systems available in the market, ELISE use Contiki-NG_. However, to comply with SDWSN principles of making the network infrastructure run simple tasks and remove energy-intensive functions from sensor nodes, we have redesigned the protocol stack. Thus, we have added support to these functionalities in Contiki-NG-SDWSN_.

* Control plane: In its core, it runs on Python_. This plane provides support to all functionalities listed in the architecture including reinforcement learning, the code resides in SDWSN-Controller_.

ELISE repository has all components added as submodules, and it also has scripts to automate experiments in the FIT-IoT-LAB_ platform. If you don't need to perform experiments in the FIT-IoT-LAB_ platform you only need to clone the Contiki-NG-SDWSN_ and the SDWSN-Controller_ repositories.
