# FIT IoT LAB 

This folder holds the scripts used to automate experiments in the [FIT IoT LAB](https://www.iot-lab.info/) facilities.

These scripts only works with the "fit-iot-lab" branch of the [Contiki-NG-SDWSN](https://github.com/fdojurado/contiki-ng) repository. Therefore, it is necessary to checkout the branch "fit-iot-lab" for contiki-ng before to proceed to run any experiment.
