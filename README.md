ELISE is built upon multidisciplinary research efforts of Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), and Machine Learning (ML).

The ELISE project comprises two main componenets: [SDWSN Network OS](https://github.com/fdojurado/contiki-ng) and the SDWSN controller.

## SDWSN Controller

The SDWSN controller features the main functionalities described below:

* Multiple controller types including a container controller for the Cooja network simulator (Only docker is supported) and a controller for FIT IoT LAB platforms.
* A Reinforcement learning module to manage the environment, reward processing, and etc.
* A mongo database that stored network information.
* TSCH module for designing and building schedules.
* Routing module to manage routing paths of the SDWSN.
* Serial interface that handles the communication with the sink node of the SDWSN.
* Packet processing module that contains a packet dissector to pack and unpack packets from the SDWSN.
* A network reconfiguration module that handles the configuration functions of the network.

## SDWSN Network OS

The SDWSN protocol, also called "**Contiki-NG-SDWSN**", is the protocol that runs on the network infrastructure or constrained devices and on the edge controller. More info can be found at https://github.com/fdojurado/contiki-ng


This repository has all components added as submodules, and it also has scripts to automate experiments in the FIT IoT LAB platform.
